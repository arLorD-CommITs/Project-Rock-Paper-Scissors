            /*
     Algorithm for Rock Paper Scissors

        1. Create function getComputerChoice. 
           This will generate a String value "Rock", "Paper" "Scissors"
           for the computer. It's random. DONE

        2. Create function that plays the round. 
           Will compare input of user from getComputerChoice.
           Then output a string on who won the round. Will use
           conditional statement for this. This will have 2 parameters,
           once for the user input, and the other for getComputerChoice
            - Make sure to acknowledge case sensitivity for user's input.

        3. Make sure to return the results of your functions. Console log
           is just for testing.
