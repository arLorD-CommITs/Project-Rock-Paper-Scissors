        /*
 Algorithm for Rock Paper Scissors

    1. Create function getComputerChoice. 
       This will generate a String value "Rock", "Paper" "Scissors"
       for the computer. It's random. DONE

    2. Create function that plays the round. 
       Will compare input of user from getComputerChoice.
       Then output a string on who won the round. Will use
       conditional statement for this. This will have 2 parameters,
       once for the user input, and the other for getComputerChoice
        - Make sure to acknowledge case sensitivity for user's input.

    3. Make sure to return the results of your functions. Console log
       is just for testing.

    4. Write a new function called game(). This will count the number of tries
    user has. Let him have 5, we can use a loop for this one. console.log
    the results as well as the winner of each game
